# Lambada Framework

Lambada framework is the first [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) implementation for [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

Using Lambada the existing JAX-RS projects can be easily deployed to AWS Lambda and API Gateway and run on a serverless architecture. Lambada only introduces some other annotations to JAX-RS meaning that it keeps compatibility with standard JAVA API.

Lambada consists of a runtime module, a maven plugin for deploying easily to API Gateway.

The project is still ongoing, so the full documentation will come in the following days.
